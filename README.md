# Machine learning: Imagimob MTBML deployment

This code example demonstrates how to deploy an Imagimob-generated machine learning model with the ModusToolbox&trade; Machine Learning (MTBML) flow. The code example includes two models that are generated from Imagimob Studio's starter projects. The first model, human activity detect, uses data from an IMU which is then sent to the model to detect specific motions: sitting, standing, walking, running, or jumping. This model runs out-of-the-box. The second model, baby crying detection, uses data from the pulse-density modulation to pulse-code modulation (PDM/PCM) which is sent to the model to detect whether a baby is crying or not.

Both models require pre-processing produced by Imagimob Studios. Human activity detect uses imu_model.c/h and baby crying detect uses pdm_model.c/.h. New models based on IMU or PDM/PCM data can be dropped into this example as-is. To collect data using the [Imagimob's Capture Server](https://bitbucket.org/imagimob/captureserver/src/master/), see the [Imagimob data collection](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ml-imagimob-data-collection) code example.

This example requires the use of ModusToolbox&trade; Machine Learning Configurator to generate sources for the Imagimob models.

This example supports models from Imagimob Studio, visit [Imagimob](https://developer.imagimob.com/) for more information and to get the Imagimob Studio download.

## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install the [Machine Learning pack](https://softwaretools.infineon.com/tools/com.ifx.tb.tool.modustoolboxpackmachinelearning).

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

Use the ModusToolbox&trade;-ML Configurator tool (from *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/packs/ModusToolbox-Machine-Learning-Pack/tools/ml-configurator/*) to load a pre-trained neural net (NN) model and generate C files to be used with this code example. Alternatively, you can launch the configurator tool in Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; from the Quick Launch window. For more information, see the [ModusToolbox&trade; Machine Learning user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxMLUserGuide).

By default, the makefile uses a model that comes with the code example. The pre-trained neural net (NN) models are located in the *Edge/IMU* and *Edge/PDM* folders. By default the code example uses the model in *Edge/IMU*. The project name is set to *imagimob_model*. You can use the ModusToolbox&trade;-ML Configurator tool to open the *design.mtbml* model to evaluate the models.

The project name is set to *IMAGIMOB_MODEL*. If you change any of these default settings, edit the following Makefile parameters of this code example:

Makefile parameter    | Description
 ---------------------| ---------------
`NN_MODEL_NAME=`      | Defines the name of the model. The name comes from the *project name* defined in the ML Configurator tool. No quotes are used when changing the name of the model.
`NN_MODEL_FOLDER=`    | Sets the name where the model files will be placed. The name comes from the *output file location* defined in the ModusToolbox&trade;-ML Configurator tool.
`NN_INFERENCE_ENGINE` | Defines the inference engine to run. It has three options: `tflm` or `tflm_less`.

For information on available inference engines, see the [ModusToolbox&trade; Machine Learning user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxMLUserGuide).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector. The example is set up to use the CY8CKIT-062S2-AI.

   If you are using the CY8CKIT-062S2-43012, update the `SHIELD_DATA_COLLECTION` variable corresponding to `APP_CY8CKIT-062S2-43012` in the *Makefile*.
   
   - if using the CY8CKIT-028-TFT shield, change to `SHIELD_DATA_COLLECTION=TFT_SHIELD` in the Makefile.
   - if using the CY8CKIT-028-EPD shield, change to `SHIELD_DATA_COLLECTION=EPD_SHIELD` in the Makefile.
   - if using the CY8CKIT-028-SENSE shield, selection depends on kit version:

   To check the version of CY8CKIT-028-SENSE, locate the sticker on the bottom of the shield's box which indicates the revision.

   - If the shield is Rev "**" or "*A", use `SHIELD_DATA_COLLECTION=SENSE_SHIELD`.
   - If the shield is Rev "*B" or later, use `SHIELD_DATA_COLLECTION=SENSE_SHIELD_v2`.


2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "Machine Learning: Imagimob MTBML Deploy" is displayed on the UART terminal.


   **Figure 1. Terminal output IMU**

   ![](images/terminal-output-imu.jpg)

5. While holding the kit board in your hand, perform various activities (sitting, standing, walking, running, jumping) and observe that the model detects and reports the correct activity. For proper detection, the sensor on the board must be oriented in the same general manner in which it is trained. The orientation for sitting and standing are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 respectively. For walking, running, and jumping the board is held the same orientation as standing with the normal arm movements associated with the respective activity.

   ![](images/standing_ai-kit.jpeg)

6. The code example includes a Baby Crying detection model that utilizes the PDM/PCM and is located in the *Edge/PDM* folder. To run the model, open the Machine Learning Configurator in Eclipse or run "make ml-configurator" in the command console. When the configurator comes up, set the **Pretrained model** to "Edge/PDM/baby_cry.h5" and select "Generate Source". 

   **Figure 6. ModusToolbox&trade; ML configurator**

   ![](images/cry_ml.jpg) 

7. To configure the application to run the Baby Crying detection model, open the *source/config.h* and set `INFERENCE_MODE_SELECT = PDM_INFERENCE`.

8. Program the device as outlined in Step 3.

9. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "Machine Learning: Imagimob MTBML Deploy" displays on the UART terminal.

   **Figure 7. Terminal output PDM**

   ![](images/terminal-output-pdm.jpg)

10. Make baby crying sounds and observe that the model detects and reports the correct classification.

11. The models and preprocessing can be updated to use other models generated by the Imagimob Studio. If updating the models and preprocessing, ensure that the preprocessing files are named imu_model.h for IMU-based projects and pdm_model.c for PDM/PCM-based projects. For more information on the Human Activity and Baby Crying projects, see [Imagimob Starter Projects](https://developer.imagimob.com/getting-started/starter-project).

12. To switch the model back to Human Activity detection, open the Machine Learning Configurator and set the **Pretrained Model** to "Edge/PDM/human_activity.h5" and select "Generate Source*. Then to configure the application to run the Human Activity model open *source/config.h* and set `INFERENCE_MODE_SELECT = IMU_INFERENCE` and program the device.

## Debugging


You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice â€“ once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation

The example includes two different models that can be run. The first is the Human Activity model that works out-of-the-box and the second is the Baby Crying model that can be configured to run. The project is designed to run one model at a time.

### Human Activity detection

The Human Activity detection model takes data from a motion sensor (BMX160 or BMI160). This example uses a combination of Imagimob's standard flow and the MTBML flow. Imagimob Studio provides the .h5 file which is input into the MTBML configurator to generate the source for the embedded device. Imagimob also produces the imu_model.c/h which contains the processing required before the data is fed to the model.

The data consists of the 3-axis accelerometer data obtained from the motion sensor. A timer is configured to interrupt at 50 Hz to sample the motion sensor. The interrupt handler reads all data from the sensor via I2C or SPI and feeds it to the Imagimob pre-processor through the IMAI_IMU_enqueue function. After the pre-processor has enough data captured, the IMAI_IMU_dequeue returns a 50 by 3 buffer stored with the pre-processed data. This data is passed to the Human Activity model through the MTBML middleware to determine the activity that is occurring. Each possible activity is assigned a confidence score. The confidence score output from the inference engine is printed to the UART terminal for review.

The pre-processor uses a 50-frame sliding window for evaluating data over a period of 1 second. The model is a standard convolutional neural network (CNN) model consisting of five convolutional groups. These groups are divided into three groups of convolutional blocks (one or two layers), a batch normalization layer, a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation layer, and a max pooling layer.

   **Figure 6. Human Activity Model layers**

   ![](images/layers.jpg)

The convolutional layers act as feature extractors and provide abstract representations of the input sensor data in feature maps. They capture short-term dependencies (spatial relationships) of the data. In the CNN, features are extracted and then used as inputs to later feature extractors, finally a softmax activation is used for final classification.

### Baby Cry detection

The Baby Crying model gathers pulse-density modulation to pulse-code modulation (PDM/PCM) audio data to classify whether a baby is crying. Imagimob Studio provides the .h5 file which is input into the MTBML configurator to generate source for the embedded device. Imagimob also produces the pdm_model.c/h which contains the processing required before the data is fed to the model.

The data consists of PDM/PCM data. The PDM/PCM is sampled at 16 kHz and an interrupt is generated after 1024 samples are collected. After 1024 samples are collected, the data is fed to the Imagimob pre-processor through the IMAI_PDM_enqueue function. After the pre-processor has enough data captured, IMAI_IMU_dequeue returns a 60 by 20 buffer stored with the pre-processed data. This data is then passed to the Baby Crying model through the MTBML middleware to determine if a baby is crying or not. The confidence that a baby is crying is produced by the inference engine and is printed on the UART terminal for review.

   **Figure 7. Baby Cry pre-processing layers**

   ![](images/pdm_processing.jpg)

The Baby Crying detect model is a 2D convolutional neural net that contains the layers as shown in the following figure.

   **Figure 8. Baby Cry model layers**

   ![](images/pdm_layers.jpg)

### Model generation

This code example ships with the Human Activity (human_activity.h5, imu_model.c/h) and the Baby Cry files (baby_cry.h5, pdm_model.c/h) produced by the Imagimob Studio. Imagimob Studio can be used to capture the new data as well as review, modify, or generate the new models for evaluation. To use a new model, ensure that the names match when on the "Edge" tab of Imagimob Studio before selecting the "build edge".

Build edge parameters | IMU | PDM
----------------------|-----|-----------
`Output Name`         | imu_model | pdm_model
`C Prefix`            | IMAI_IMU_ | IMAI_PDM_
`Build`               | Preprocessor | Preprocessor

<br>

   **Figure 9. IMU build edge parameters example**

   ![](images/imu_build_edge.jpg)

The generated .h5 file and the xxx_model.c/h files can then be copied into *Edge/IMU* or *Edge/PDM* depending on the selected sensor. To run the new model, open the Machine Learning Configurator, set the **Pretrained model** to the newly trained model, and select "Generate Source*. Then configure the application for the desired sensor by opening *source/config.h* and setting `INFERENCE_MODE_SELECT = PDM_INFERENCE` or `INFERENCE_MODE_SELECT = IMU_INFERENCE`.
